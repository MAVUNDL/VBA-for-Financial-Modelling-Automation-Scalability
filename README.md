- 💡 **Annuities, Perpetuities, and Amortization** – Modelling periodic cash flows
- 💼 **Profit & Loss (P&L)** – Introduction to accounting and economic P&L within a Murex context

### 🔧 Tools Built in Excel:
- Simple and Compound Interest calculators
- Annuity and Perpetuity models

## 🤖 Week 2: VBA for Financial Modelling – *Automation & Scalability*

This week marked our transition into **automation using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**. We began integrating Excel models with VBA to streamline and enhance functionality.

### ✅ Skills and Concepts Learned:
- 🧠 **VBA Fundamentals** – Variables, loops, conditionals, subs, and functions
- ⚙️ **Interactive Tools** – Input boxes, MsgBoxes, and dynamic user-driven scripts
- 📄 **Automated Financial Tools** – Compound interest, annuities, and amortization calculators
- 💱 **Formatting & Presentation** – Rand (ZAR) currency and percentage formatting in VBA
- 📊 **Dynamic Table Generation** – Auto-creating and clearing amortization tables
- 💼 **Murex Integration Prep** – Structuring logic like real banking system operations

## 🎯 Personal Growth & Impact

These two weeks have significantly deepened my understanding of **financial instruments**, **interest rate mechanics**, and **structured modelling**. The practical exposure to Excel and VBA development has enhanced my ability to think like a systems analyst—balancing accuracy, efficiency, and user interactivity.
